Otherwise, score the response from 1 (very poor) to 10 (excellent) based on the following categories:

1. Clarity
2. Professionalism
3. Relevance to the question
4. Technical/Role-Specific Accuracy
5. Problem-Solving & Critical Thinking
6. Experience & Resume Alignment

Format your response like this:
